# It is interesting to note that the odd squares
# lie along the bottom right diagonal,
# but what is more interesting is that
# 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime;
# that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
#
# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above,
# a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.
# If this process is continued,
# what is the side length of the square spiral for which
# the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
